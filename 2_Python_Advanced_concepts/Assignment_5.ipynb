    "# Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "# Delegation is a design pattern in which an object, called the delegate, is responsible for performing certain tasks on behalf of another object, called the delegator. This can be done by the delegator forwarding method calls and attribute access to the delegate. In its most basic form, delegation can be implemented using the following approach: the delegator passes requests for certain actions to the delegate, which then performs the actions on behalf of the delegator.\n",
